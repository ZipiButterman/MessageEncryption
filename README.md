# MessageEncryption
This program functions as a client-server system with the primary aim of transmitting encrypted messages from the client to the server, which then displays them on the screen. 
Before sending any messages, the client undergoes authentication via a password check with the authentication server (Kerberos).  
Only after successful authentication can the client proceed to send messages to the message server.
